    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a way to analyze how the running time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input grows. 
        Writing algorithms with low time complexity makes them more efficient and faster for larger inputs.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses while running. 
        For example, an algorithm may have a space requirement of O(n), meaning the memory grows linearly with input size.
